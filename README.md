### Name of the Project:

Gratitude- Guided Gifting

### Overview of the project:

A guided gifting application for adults. 

An application that removes the anxiety from gift-giving and makes the user and their loved ones feel special on any occasion. 

The need for this application became clear when I realized most online registries cater to two events-- weddings and baby showers. While those are definitely reasons to celebrate, I wanted to see an application that fit all different styles of living and one that included events that are tailored to the users personal causes for celebrating. Too, I thought a one-stop-shop,  as opposed to store-specific registries, would be a valuable way to streamline the process for guided gifting while being centered on milestones that suit the user. 

When a user logs into the application, they can create a reoccuring event like a birthday or a special event like a promotion or house-warming! They can also create categories like skincare, music, movies, etc. 

The user can then store gifts in categories or events. Gifts will include information like images, description, price, purchase options, and options to share with the public or only close friends.
